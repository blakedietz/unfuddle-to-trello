# unfuddle-to-trello

## Purpose
The main purpose of this project is to create a small but useful tool for exporting unfuddle tickets into a specified list in a trello selected by the user.

## Technologies

This little project was also a great chance for me to use some newer technologies. Currently the project is written without jQuery (although jQuery is a dependency for the Trello authentication).

* ES6
  * Symbols
  * Classes
  * let
  * =>
  * Promise
* HTML5 dom apis
